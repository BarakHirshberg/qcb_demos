# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Keep this file current.** After any *major* change — a new app, a new panel,
> an architectural shift, a new convention, or a hard-won gotcha — update the
> relevant section here in the same change. Do **not** log minor tweaks (small
> styling, label/copy edits, one-off fixes).

## What this is

Interactive, browser-based visualizations of undergraduate quantum-mechanics
systems, built as a teaching companion. Pure static site — **no build step, no
framework, no bundler**. Everything is computed client-side from exact analytic
eigenfunctions. Hosted free on GitHub Pages.

Live: https://barakhirshberg.github.io/qcb_demos/

**Status:** all five apps — **Hydrogen atom**, **Harmonic oscillator**,
**Particle in a box**, **Particle on a sphere**, **Particle on a ring** — are
complete and deployed. (The `.soon` / `.badge-soon` CSS and the "coming soon"
pattern are now unused but kept for any future app.) Nav order is kept consistent
across every page and follows the course's order of appearance: Home · Particle
in a box · Particle on a ring · Harmonic oscillator · Particle on a sphere ·
Hydrogen atom.

## Commands

```bash
# Run locally (the only way to "run" it — it's static):
python3 -m http.server 8000          # then open http://localhost:8000

# Physics self-tests (normalization integrals) print to the BROWSER console:
#   open .../hydrogen/?test   (or append #test)
```

There is **no test runner, linter, or package.json**. The math is verified two ways:

1. **Browser self-tests:** `selfTest()` in `js/special.js` checks ∫|R|²r²dr,
   ∫|Y|²dΩ, ∫|ψ|²dx ≈ 1; triggered by `?test` in the URL.
2. **Node + screenshots for offline verification** (see "Verification workflow").

## Architecture

- **`js/special.js`** — the math core and single source of truth. Plain ES module,
  no DOM. Associated Laguerre/Legendre, Hermite, complex & real spherical
  harmonics, radial `R_nℓ`, `oscPsi`, plus exact rational-coefficient generators
  (`laguerreCoeffs`, `legendreCoeffs`, `assocLegendreParts`) used to render the
  explicit polynomials in the UI. Atomic units: Bohr radius `a = 1`, `Z = 1`,
  and ħ=m=ω=1 for the oscillator. Includes `selfTest()`.
- **`js/ui.js`** — shared UI helpers: `segmented()` (the button-group selectors),
  `math()` (KaTeX render), `layout()`/`CONFIG`/`CONFIG_3D` (dark Plotly theme),
  `fmt`, `fracTex`, `COL` palette.
- **`assets/css/style.css`** — all styling; dark theme; `.grid.cols-2/3`,
  `.card`, `.seg` selectors, `.soon` (coming-soon styling).
- **Per-app folder** (`hydrogen/`) — `index.html` (loads Plotly + KaTeX from CDN,
  the shared CSS, and its module script) + one JS module. Each app owns its
  layout and rendering but imports all physics from `js/special.js`.

External deps are **CDN-only** (Plotly.js, KaTeX) — intentional, for zero-build
longevity. Don't add npm/bundling.

### Hydrogen app (`hydrogen/hydrogen.js`) — the non-obvious parts

- `state = {n,l,m,isoFrac,showNodes}`. `render()` rebuilds everything; the iso
  slider and nodes toggle call only `drawClouds()` (cheap). Quantum-number
  selectors enforce validity: changing `n` rebuilds the `l` options, `l` rebuilds
  `m` (`ℓ=0…n−1`, `m=−ℓ…+ℓ`). URL params: `?n=&l=&m=&nodes=0|1` (also for
  shareable links and screenshot testing).
- **3D rendering strategy (important):** the complex `|ψ|²` and any real orbital
  with `m=0` are **axially symmetric**, so they are drawn as a smooth
  *surface of revolution*: fine 2-D `(s,z)` contour via `marchingSquares` →
  `revolveMesh` (mesh3d). Only the **non-axisymmetric real orbitals (m≠0)** use a
  3-D Plotly `isosurface` (`build3DReal` + `isoTrace3`). This avoids the speckle
  artifacts a coarse Cartesian isosurface produces for high-n shells.
- **Boundary-surface level = enclosed probability** (slider, default 90%), found
  by sorting voxel/cell densities (`cutoff2D`/`cutoff3D`), not "% of max".
- **Nodes overlay** (`nodeTraces`): radial spheres (`n−ℓ−1`), polar cones
  (`ℓ−|m|`, a flat disk at ϑ=90°), azimuthal planes (`|m|`, real orbital only).
- Angular panel: Θ(ϑ) amplitude + |Θ|² density as **polar** plots; Θ and Φ as
  **Cartesian** plots (angle axes in **radians**, π ticks rendered serif/italic).
- **Energy panel** (`renderEnergy`): Coulomb well `V(r)=−1/r` + the ladder
  `E_n=−1/2n²` (atomic units), each level drawn to its turning point `r_n=2n²`
  and converging to the ionization limit `E=0`. Only the **selected** level is a
  line split into its `n²` degenerate states (one segment per state, grouped/
  colored by ℓ, selected state circled); the other levels are plain lines.

### Particle on a sphere (`sphere/sphere.js`) — rigid rotor

Reuses the hydrogen **angular** machinery (Θ/Φ panels, `legendreTex`, node
helpers, all the special-function imports) — no radial part. Differences:
- State is just `{l, m, showNodes}` (no n); controls offer ℓ and m=−ℓ…+ℓ.
- **Energy** `renderEnergy`: free particle, no potential. Ladder `E_ℓ=ℓ(ℓ+1)`
  (units ℏ²/2I) on a schematic x-axis; levels spread *apart* with ℓ. The selected
  level is split into its **2ℓ+1** m-states (one segment each, labeled by m,
  selected circled); others are plain lines.
- **3D** `drawBalloon`: parametric *surface* (not isosurface) with radius
  `r(ϑ,φ)=|Y|²` (complex, single color) or `|Y_real|` (sign-colored blue/red) —
  the spherical-harmonic "balloons". Node overlay = polar cones + (real only)
  azimuthal planes; no radial spheres.

### Particle on a ring (`ring/ring.js`) — planar rotor

Just the φ part. State `{m, basis}` (m = −6…6; basis complex/real). Energy
`E_m=m²` (units ℏ²/2I); ±m share each level (`renderEnergy` splits the selected
level into its 1 or 2 states). `Φ_m=e^{imφ}/√(2π)` (complex, traveling, uniform
|Φ|²) ⇄ real standing waves cos/sin(mφ) (with 2|m| nodes). 3-D `renderRing`: a
`scatter3d` line around the unit circle, height = Re Φ, colored by **phase** mφ
(cyclic colorscale, complex) or **sign** (real).

### Harmonic oscillator (`oscillator/oscillator.js`)

Dimensionless units: x in √(ℏ/μω) (α = μω/ℏ = 1), E in ℏω. Uses `oscPsi`,
`oscClassical`, `hermiteCoeffs` from `special.js`. State `{n, classical}`.
- `renderLevels`: parabola V=½x² + equally-spaced lines E_n=(n+½) (ΔE=ℏω); the
  selected ψ_n is drawn on its energy line (scaled), with classical turning
  points x_t=√(2n+1) dashed.
- `renderWave`/`renderDensity`: ψ_n(x) (nodes marked) and |ψ_n|² with the
  classical probability `1/(π√(x_t²−x²))` overlaid (toggle). Notation per the
  course notes: ψ_n=N_n H_n(√α x)e^{−αx²/2}, N_n=(2ⁿn!)^{-1/2}(α/π)^{1/4},
  physicists' Hermite (shown explicitly above the plots). A "zoom to level"
  toggle frames the selected level (y-axis) so the on-level ψ_n is legible
  (default off = full ladder); `?zoom=1` URL param.

### Particle in a box (`box/box.js`) — one app, four modes

`state.mode` ∈ {`1d`,`2d`,`2p`,`2pi`} drives everything; panels/controls are
shown/hidden via `setVisibility()` (no separate pages). Units: L=1, E in h²/8mL².
- **1d:** ψ_n=√(2/L)sin(nπx/L), E_n=n²; walls + n² ladder with ψ_n on its line, ψ/|ψ|² plots.
  A "zoom to level" toggle (1d only) frames the selected level so the on-level ψ_n is legible.
- **2d:** ψ=(2/L)sin(nₓπx)sin(n_yπy), E=nₓ²+n_y²; degeneracy ladder, signed-ψ + |ψ|² heatmaps, 3-D surface.
- **2p:** identical product math (the notes' point: 2D box ≡ two non-interacting 1D particles),
  labels x₁/x₂, E=E₁+E₂. Extra `drawSlice()` panel: a slider "particle 1 found at x₁" with a line on
  the joint |ψ|² and the conditional P(x₂|x₁) shown to coincide with the marginal |φ(x₂)|² for any x₁
  ⇒ **no correlation** (the joint factorizes).
- **2pi (two interacting particles):** screened/soft Coulomb `Ĥ = T₁+T₂ + C/√((x₁−x₂)²+η²)`
  (η=`ETA`=0.05), solved numerically by **configuration interaction** in the box product basis
  (cf. Guy Cohen's demo, but CI not dense real-space — browser-friendly). `buildV1()` precomputes
  the unit-strength interaction matrix once (`CI_NMAX`=10 → 100×100, via the intermediate `W`);
  `solveCI(U)` forms H=H₀+C·V1 and diagonalizes with `eighJacobi` (cyclic-Jacobi symmetric
  eigensolver in `special.js`), cached in `ciCache`. Controls: an interaction slider **C** (0…`UMAX`=10,
  rAF-throttled `scheduleU`→`render`) and an eigenstate index **k** (`seg-k`, lowest `KSHOW`=8 levels).
  **No energy diagram** for this mode (the whole `card-energy` is hidden — found confusing); instead the
  Hamiltonian is shown in the wavefunction panel via `eq-2pi`, and the selected state/energy/C are in the
  `h2-2d` heading. The 2D/3D
  panels and `drawSlice()` read a shared module-level `field = {u, Zp, Zd, amax}`: `buildFieldProduct`
  (factorized 2p) or `buildFieldCI(vec)` (correlated 2pi). At C>0 the joint |ψ|² is depleted along the
  diagonal x₁=x₂ and the conditional P(x₂|x₁) (computed numerically from `field.Zd`) **shifts with x₁**
  ⇒ **correlation**. C=0 recovers the uncorrelated product (validated: ground E=2.00 exactly).

## Conventions (match the course notes — keep consistent across apps)

- Polar angle **ϑ** (vartheta), azimuthal **φ** (varphi), angular quantum number
  **ℓ** (not `l` in displayed math), reduced mass **μ**, Bohr radius **a**,
  nuclear charge **Z**, potential `Ze²/r`.
- Radial function is **eq. (33)**: `R_nℓ = N_nℓ e^{−Zr/na}(2Zr/na)^ℓ L_{n−ℓ−1}^{2ℓ+1}(2Zr/na)`;
  `N_nℓ` is eq. (35); the Laguerre argument is `x = 2Zr/na`. Radial probability
  shown as `P(r)=|R|²r²` (eq. 39). Source PDF: the user's `class12_hydrogen_atom.pdf`.
- Each plot shows the explicit polynomial above it (Laguerre for radial, the
  associated Legendre `P_ℓ^m(cosϑ)` for angular), mirroring the notes.

## Verification workflow (offline, this machine)

`special.js` runs under Node only as an ES module:

```bash
cp js/special.js /tmp/special.mjs            # node needs the .mjs extension
node --experimental-modules /tmp/<test>.mjs  # import from /tmp/special.mjs
```

To exercise an app's `render()` headlessly, load the module with stubbed
`window/document/katex/Plotly` globals (Plotly.react = no-op) and invoke the
stored DOMContentLoaded handler — catches runtime errors without a browser.

**Visual checks: use Firefox, not Chrome.** Headless Chrome's WebGL is broken on
this machine (Plotly 3D renders empty/wrong). Firefox works:

```bash
MOZ_HEADLESS=1 firefox --headless --profile /tmp/ffX --window-size=1500,2600 \
  --screenshot /tmp/out.png "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hydrogen/?n=3&l=2&m=0&nodes=1"
```

Use a **fresh `--profile` dir** each time, or Firefox caches the old JS. Crop
regions with ImageMagick `convert in.png -crop WxH+X+Y +repage out.png`.

## Node version gotcha

Local Node is **v10** (browsers run modern JS; this only affects offline test
scripts). Avoid in test scripts: top-level `await`, `globalThis` (use `global`),
`&&=`/`||=`. ES modules require `.mjs` + `--experimental-modules`.

## Plotly gotcha

For a single 3-D isosurface, do **not** rely on `surface.count: 1` — it can draw
near the density peak instead of at the requested level (shrinks the orbital to a
dot). Use `isomin = level`, `isomax = maxValue`, `surface.count: 2`, caps off
(see `isoTrace3`).

## Deploy

GitHub Pages, **"Deploy from a branch" → `main` / root** (NOT GitHub Actions — an
Actions workflow was tried and removed because it failed/was overkill for a
static site). `.nojekyll` makes Pages serve files as-is. Every push to `main`
republishes (~1 min). On this machine `gh` is **not installed** and there is **no
GitHub token**, but **SSH push works** (authenticated as `BarakHirshberg`):

```bash
git push origin main   # remote: git@github.com:BarakHirshberg/qcb_demos.git
```

Commit messages end with a `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` line. Commit/push only
when the user asks.
